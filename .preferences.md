# Coding Style Preferences - rb-mono-repo

## Forbidden Patterns (Religion-Level Preferences)

- ❌ `class` keyword - use functional patterns only
- ❌ `interface` keyword - use type aliases instead
- ❌ Code comments - let the code speak for itself
- ❌ Single-argument functions - inline them directly when used only once
- ❌ never use for\while loops; prefer Array.prototype
- ❌ never use var\let statements; always use const
- ❌ never write mutable code
- ❌ never write comments in code; prefer extracting to functions with meaningful names

## Preferred Patterns

- ✅ Functional composition over OOP
- ✅ Type aliases over interfaces
- ✅ Inline single-use functions
- ✅ Fluent APIs with method chaining
- ✅ Curried functions for reusability
- ✅ Pure functions without side effects
- ✅ Builder patterns using functions, not classes
- ✅ Always use immutable code, achieving mutations in a function way

## Code Structure

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use readonly types for immutability
- Prefer explicit types over inference when unclear
- Use descriptive variable names
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Use const assertions where appropriate

## TypeScript Specifics

- Prefer `type` over `interface` always
- Use function expressions over function declarations
- Leverage discriminated unions for state management
- Use mapped types and conditional types when appropriate

## Architecture

- Functional programming patterns
- Immutable data structures
- Clean separation of concerns without over-engineering
- Simple, readable code over clever abstractions
